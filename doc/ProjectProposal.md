TITLE
CrimeStats - A web application that provides interactive reports on crime statistics in Los Angeles.

SUMMARY
The proposed project aims to develop a comprehensive Crime Statistics and Reporting System for Los Angeles, California, with a wide range of features to enhance public safety and provide valuable insights into crime trends. The system will feature a user-friendly interface that allows residents to search for crime statistics in their specific area of interest within LA. Users can apply various filters to customize the data aggregation, such as age vs. area, area vs. time of day, and more. One of the key components of this system is the graphical representation of the LA map, which will visually depict crime density in different areas, enabling users to make informed decisions about safety. Additionally, a user portal will empower residents to report crimes, with backend validation to verify the authenticity of the reports. Duplicate reports will be automatically detected and handled, maintaining accurate records of unique incidents.

For law enforcement, a specialized login will provide access to raw and unprocessed crime data. The system will also utilize machine learning algorithms to predict crime trends on a weekly and monthly basis, enabling proactive measures for public safety. Furthermore, the system will include notification banners to disseminate safety warnings based on recent crimes. Lastly, an admin login will be available for database administrators to manage the system efficiently. This comprehensive Crime Statistics and Reporting System will not only empower residents but also assist law enforcement agencies in their efforts to ensure public safety in Los Angeles.
